    <h3>User Interviews</h3>
    <div class="portfolio__side-by-side">
      <div>
        <p>I created an interview script based on the project brief, research goals, and competitive analysis. The first round of interviews involved 3 participants; although good data was collected from these interviews, I found that the first interview script was not soliciting enough information about how users select particular destinations on travel sites. A second round of interviews with 2 additional participants, conducted with an updated script, addressed this issue.</p>
        <p>The interview revealed the users’ main motivations and pain points when using travel sites:</p>
        <div class="portfolio__side-by-side">

              <li>Reliable information about prices </li>

      <div>
        <p>To understand how to categorize the trips Zeit offers in ways that would match users’ mental maps,  I conducted an open card sorting activity using OptimalWorkshop. I created 30 trips cards spanning the wide range of trips that Zeit offers and asked 3 participants to sort them into categories.</p>
        <p>The 3 participants grouped the trips by continent and themes. Because there was little overlap among the categories the original participants created, I decided to conduct the card sort activity with 2 additional participants to gather more data. The 2 additional participants sorted the cards into categories based on historical era and themes.</p>

    <h3>Task and User Flows</h3>
    <p>Based on the project brief, persona, and site map, I created task and user flows for Zeit to better understand how users would interact with the site. The task flow explores the purchasing of a trip, while the user flow explores searching and saving a trip for later purchase. Two other user flows, not depicted, demonstrate the processes for retrieving and purchasing a saved trip and for reviewing a completed trip.</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <div class="portfolio__side-by-side">
    <div>
      <p>Completing my first UX project was challenging, but rewarding. I learned that my current strengths are research, analysis, problem definition and solving, and wireframing, while I need to spend more time working on ideating through sketching and visual design. If I had more time with this project, I would consider lighter color schemes—although the current color palette matches the brand inspiration and overall desired feel for the site, it is a little dark and heavy.</p>
      <p>My favorite part of the project was thinking of creative ways for users to interact with the homepage to browse trips. I wanted the site to inspire the same kind of wonder and awe in the user as the idea of time travel. I think the creative interactive elements of the homepage—the timeline and the map—help achieve this goal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio__card portfolio__card--green">
      <h3 class="h--4 style--center">Next Steps</h3>
      <p>Were this project to continue, there are several steps I would take to improve the user experience and design.</p>
      <ol class="ol">
        <li>Add the new wireframes I created after usability testing to the prototype, conduct a new round of usability tests, iterate as needed, and incorporate the new design pattern into the responsive UI designs.</li>
        <li>Build out more of the designs for the mobile site for additional practice in creating mobile design patterns and mobile UI designs.</li>
