      <p>My professional journey has been shaped by a life-long love of learning, insatiable curiosity, and desire to help others learn, grow, and achieve. Before moving into UX, I earned a PhD in history, taught college history courses, and worked in higher education publishing as a project manager and associate development editor.

      <h2 class="h--4">Historian</h2>
      <p>As a historian, I developed an expertise in using critical thinking to analyze potentially biased data and understand the mindset of people very different from me that I now apply to conducting user research, analyzing research data, and developing user personas and related artifacts.</p>

      <h2 class="h--4">Educator</h2>
