      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Rebecca Favorito and I’m a UX designer based in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
      <p>My professional journey has been shaped by a life-long love of learning, insatiable curiosity, and desire to help others learn, grow, and achieve. Before moving into UX, I earned a PhD in history, taught college history courses, and worked in higher education publishing as a project manager and associate development editor. My interest in UX was sparked by my experiences developing content for an e-learning platform&#8212;I began to wonder about the whys behind the ways the platform was structured and designed.</p>
      <p class="style--hidden-mobile">My background in education and publishing has contributed to my growth as a UX designer in a number of ways: </p>

    <h2 class="h--4">Historian</h2>
    <p>As a historian, I developed an expertise in using critical thinking to analyze potentially biased data and understand the mindset of people very different from me that I now apply to conducting user research, analyzing research data, and developing user personas and related artifacts.</p>
