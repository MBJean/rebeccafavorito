    <h3>User Research</h3>
    <div class="portfolio__side-by-side portfolio__side-by-side--weight-right">
      <div>
        <p>I created an 11-question survey based on the project brief, research goals, and competitive analysis. The survey was targeted to current GROWL! customers and advertised on flyers in the bar and on social media.</p>
        <p>In the first section, participants were asked demographic questions to help identify GROWLS!’s main customer bases. In the second section, participants were asked questions about their patronage of GROWL! Finally, participants were asked questions about the GROWL! website.</p>
        <p>The 32 respondents shared many similar characteristics and opinions about GROWL! and its website.</p>

      <p>I created a product roadmap to list, describe, and prioritize the features of the updated GROWL! site.

        <p>I began by creating mid-fidelity wireframes for the Homepage and About page, and then created variations on those layouts for the other pages of the site. The wireframes establish visual hiearchy through color and layout and emphasize the use images to create a sense of the atmosphere and character of GROWL!</p>
        <p>I also created wireframes for the mobile version of the site (not pictured). They layout of all the pages would be further refined as I worked on the UI designs, including shrinking the size of the hero images somewhat to ensure other content appeared above the fold, encouraging users to scroll.</p>

  <section class="section--no-padding">
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p class="style--75">Based on the results of the usability testing, I determined that the redesigned site had established a clear visual hierarchy, was easy to use, and strongly conveyed the brand identity. Analyzing the test results demonstrated some issues with the set up of usability tests, including the need for clearer instructions for some of the tasks and the need to anticipate more potential paths through each task.</p>
    <p class="style--75">Follow the usability tests, I made some changes to the layout and design of the pages as I moved from wireframes to UI designs, such as reducing the size of the hero images—an issues noted by test participants—to bring more content above the fold and encourage users to scroll. I also made some changes to the designs based on feedback from the business owner and developer, such as removing the search function. Neither thought it was necessary since the overall structure and organization of the site were clear, simple, and easy to navigate.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <div class="portfolio__side-by-side">
    <div>
      <p>Working on this project provided a great opportunity to learn about best practices for local business websites and SEO and to focus on information architecture and visual design. My previous experience as a project manager helped me fulfill my dual roles on the project and communicate effectively with the business owner and developer.</p>
      <p>I learned a lot about balancing the needs of different stakeholders on a UX project and challenges of creating a fresh design within the boundaries of an existing brand style with a defined color palette.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio__card portfolio__card--green">
      <h3 class="h--4 style--center">Next Steps</h3>
      <p>This project is currently in development, with the redesigned site scheduled to go live sometime in September 2019. The final steps needed before that can happen are:</p>
      <ol class="ol">
        <li>Obtain outstanding content from the business owner and incorporate into the UI designs.</li>
        <li>Turnover final content to the developer to go live.</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <p>Phase 2 of the project will include designing and developing an admin portal for the business owner to use to update certain content on the site. If the project continues beyond phase 2, potential next steps include:</p>
      <ol class="ol">
        <li>Conducting another round usability testing using the UI designs and additional scenarios and adjusting the designs and features as needed.</li>
        <li>Building out additional content pages that go more in-depth into some of the unique features of the bar, such as providing a library of games and records available on site.</li>
        <li>Research into rebranding.</li>
      </ol>
