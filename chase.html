    <h3>User Research</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="column column--6">
        <p>I created a 10-question survey based on the project brief, research goals, and competitive analysis. The survey was targeted to millennials, defined as those born from 1981 through 1996, and was posted on social media sites including Facebook and Slack.</p>
        <p>In the first section, participants were asked demographic questions to determine whether millennials of different ages might have different financial needs. In the second section, participants were asked questions about their financial status and how they currently manage their personal finances.</p>
        <p>The 32 respondents shared similar motivations and pain points in managing their finances:</p>

    <h3>Persona</h3>
    <p class="style--75">Three personas were created to represent the different ages and main financial concerns of the survey participants. The survey data showed that millennials in their mid 20s (Nick), late 20s to early 30s (Noel), and mid 30s (Ana) tended to have somewhat different budgeting and savings needs while sharing many overall concerns regarding personal financial management.</p>

The lower priority features supplement and complement the must-have basic features.</p>

I decided to call the tool “My Budget”  to form a connection with the user and highlight the customizability of the tool.</p>

I found mapping out the onboarding and check-in processes to be important for understanding how users would customize the app to suit their own needs and mapping out tasks such as checking budget alerts to be important for understanding how users would interact with the app on a regular basis. I created user flows for the onboarding processes, checking a budget alert (depicted below), completing a check-in, and learning about investing/opening an investment account.</p>

    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p class="style--75">I began by studying the Chase app, including taking screenshots of different pages and features. I then sketched out some variants of the main My Budget screens before using Sketch to create mid-fidelity wireframes. To fulfill the goal of having My Budget fit seamlessly into the Chase app, I used the existing UI design of the app whenever possible, including replicating the design of items such as graphs from other parts of the app.  I annotated the mid-fidelity wireframes to note key features and interactions and show the flows between screens.</p>

    <h3>UI Designs</h3>

The UI design notably employs the iconic Chase blue palette to create a clear hierarchy and effective visuals. I also created several new icons for My Budget using the existing icons for the Daily Snapshot feature as models.</p>

      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
      <p>To test the structure and flow of the site, I conducted remote usability tests using the Invision prototype and Maze. Because My Budget closely follows the use and interaction patterns of the existing Chase app, I limited participants to millennials who are current users of the Chase app to ensure my results focused on the usability of the new feature rather than of the Chase app itself. The scenarios focus on ways in which users would interact with the app on a regular basis.</p>
      <div class="section--scenarios">
        <section class="section--scenario">
          <h3 class="h--4">Scenario 1</h3>
          <p>Adjust the monthly budget for the Automotive budget category from $350 to $325.</p>

          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br/>
      <p>After completing each scenario, users were asked to provide reflections on the ease of the tasks and how well the new feature integrated into the Chase app in terms of design and functionality.</p>

  <section class="section--no-padding">
    <h3>Affinity Map</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="column column--7">
        <p>Using the test participants’ reflections, I created an affinity map that drew out the similarities in their responses to the My Budget feature, its usability, and its design. Their main reflections:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li>My Budget felt similar to the rest of the Chase app and behaved as expected</li>
          <li>The tasks were straightfoward and intuitive to complete</li>
          <li>Some thought the visiblity of the CTAs was good, while others had difficulty finding certain CTAs at first</li>

    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="section--no-padding">
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p class="style--75">Based on the results of the usability testing, I determined that My Budget is well integrated into the Chase app and that no major changes were needed to the design. I considered whether a design change was needed to highlight some of the CTAs, but determined that this issue would likely be resolved by the application of the UI design. The overwhelming success rate for the usability testing, however, suggests that the scenarios may have been too easy overall.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="column column--5">
      <p>This was my first mobile app project. As a current user of the Chase mobile app, I found it fun to explore the app in depth and interesting to think about ways in which the app could further serve Chase customers. And as a millennial myself, I closely identified with the concerns of my users regarding their finances and their aspirations for tools that could help them create and manage budgets more easily and learn more about personal financial management.</p>
      <p>I learned a lot about the challenges of working within an existing information architecture, user experience design, and user interface design. One of the more difficult aspects of this project was making sure I correctly understood the existing interaction patterns in the app and applied them consistently to My Budget. Since the only mobile designs I’d worked on previously were for mobile websites, I also had to think carefully about the functionality and design differences between mobile websites and mobile apps.</p>

    <div class="column column--6 portfolio__card portfolio__card--green">
      <h3 class="h--4 style--center">Next Steps</h3>
      <p>Were this project to continue, there are several steps I would take to improve the user experience and design.</p>
      <ol class="ol">
        <li>Build out additional wireframes, including the navigation menu.</li>
        <li>Define more challenging tasks for usability testing, build out the nessary wireframes, and complete a second round of usability testing.</li>
        <li>Confirm that all interaction patterns conform to patterns already existing in the Chase app or have justifiable reasons to be new/different.</li>
