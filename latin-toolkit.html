          <p>I created an 11-question interview guide based on the project brief, research goals, and competitive analysis and arranged to conduct 30-minute phone interviews with 3 experienced Latin instructors. All 3 instructors have taught the entire Latin sequence (beginning to advanced) and have an average of over 7 years of experience teaching Latin.</p>
          <p>The instructors were asked about their teaching experiences, with a focus on the materials they use in class, the concepts their students have the most difficulty with, and their use of technology in teaching.</p>
          <p>Through the interviews, I identified several common problems Latin students have in learning the language, as well as some of the major issues that professors face when using technology as a teaching and learning tool.</p>

The persona highlights both the issues Latin instructors have with using technology as a teaching tool and the major problems their students to have with learning the language.</p>
        <p>The persona was a valuable tool for considering the overall structure and main features and functions of the app from the instructor perspective, and helped shaped a product designed to be as easy for instructors to use as possible while still being pedagogically valuable and, eventually, fully customizable.</p>

        <p>After completing the product roadmap, I began brainstorming and iterating on the structure of the app. The image shows the anticipated structure for the first phase of app development, which will focus on the instructor experience in setting up a course. The app has features that only instructors will be allowed to access, as indicated in the map, but one major goal of the design is to have instructors be able to view and interact with the app the same way students would to allow instructors to more effectively introduce the app to their students and address any issues their students might have with the app.</p>

        <p>For the user flows, I focused on the tasks an instructor would need to accomplish to set up and publish a new course in the app.</p>

        <p>The wireframes for this project went through several stages of development, beginning with sketching.  Originally, the development plan included the ability to edit the activities in each activity group as part of the first phase of development, so I sketched out several variations on how editing might work in the app. After further consideration, however, the team decided to move the editing function to a later stage of development due to provide more time for research, designing, and developing this complicated feature.</p>
        <p>After creating the sketches, I developed mid-fidelity wireframes in Sketch to further iterate on the designs, establish a clear visual hierarchy, and prepare for usability testing and user interface designs. The flowmap shows the first version of these Sketch wireframes and demonstrates some of the main user flows through them.</p>

    <h3>Brand Tile</h3>
    <div class="portfolio__side-by-side">
      <div>
        <p>After discussing brand attributes and potential brand colors with the creator of the app, I searched for design inspiration and began putting together a color palette and typography options.</p>
        <p>Focusing on purple as the brand color because of its associations with wisdom and the Roman Empire, I created a primary brand color palette of purple, a golden yellow (gold also has imperial connotations), grey, and white. Secondary colors were added to the palette to add vitality to icons and other small details.</p>
        <p>The display font—Chivo—was chosen because of its modern, approachable, and easily readable design.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="portfolio__side-by-side">
      <div>
        <p>Finally, I researched inspiration for logo designs using key terms related to both the brand attributes and the Latin language/Roman history. After discussions with the app creator, I settled on the image of Janus—the two-faced god—as the focus of the logo. As the god of beginnings and endings, openings and closings, looking backwards and forwards, and the transition from youth to adulthood, Janus makes a fitting symbol for an app that incorporates the latest pedagogical methods to teach a classical language.</p>

    <h3>Affinity Map</h3>
    <div class="portfolio__side-by-side portfolio__side-by-side--weight-right">
      <div>
        <p>I created an affinity map to analyze the qualitative data I gathered from the testers’ reflections on each mission. Most testers agreed that it was easy to accomplish scenarios 1-3, that the user interface acted as expected, and that the tasks were intuitive. Testers found scenario 4 to be more challenging because of the several steps it took to edit the due date: most testers expected to be able to click on an activity to edit its due date. However, several testers  agreed that once they figured out what they needed to do, the task was easy.</p>
        <p>Although scenario 1 had a significant drop-off rate, my analysis concluded that this had more to do with the set up of the prototype than wth the usability of the design. Testers who clicked on the sign-in area instead of the sign up link were actually able to sign in to the prototype and enter a loop they could not escape. This issue will be taken into consideration during the creation of any future prototypes or usability tests.</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p class="style--66">Based on the results of the usability testing, I determined that no major changes were needed to the wireframe designs related to scenarios 1-3. In light of the results for scenario 4, I discussed the editing process with the app’s creator. We decided to simplfy the editing process and, for now at least, restrict editing in the mobile app to activity due dates. I iterated on the wireframes to this end, and applied the UI designs to the updated screens.</p>
    <p class="style--66">We had originally conceptualized allowing instructors to edit which activities were in each activity group, as well as the actual content of the activities, in the app, but based on the issues we encountered in wireframe development and usability testing, we are now exploring the idea of limiting editing in the app to the tasks mentioned above and creating a robust web application for more complicated editing tasks.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <div class="portfolio__side-by-side">
    <div>
      <p>Working on this project has allowed me to explore one of my passions—the intersection of instructional design and user experience design. It’s also provided valuable experience in working with the creator of a product, balancing the creator’s vision with user needs and other vital considerations, and working on a truly iterative, multi-stage project. The work detailed in this case study is only the first stage in the development of the Latin Toolkit, and I look forward to the work that will be done in later stages.</p>
      <p>I learned a lot about balancing different users’ needs, as well as how to approach designing a complex product that will go through long-term design and development in multiple stages. Working on the logo and branding helped advance my skills in Adobe Illustrator and visual design.</p>

      <h3 class="h--4 style--center">Next Steps</h3>
      <p>This project is currently in stage 1 of development, with the schedule for later stages still to be determined. In terms of stage 1, next steps include:</p>
      <ol class="ol">
        <li>Continue refining the UI design, including creating a slightly cleaner design for the icons.</li>
        <li>Creating and iterating on additional wireframes to continue building out the screens necessary for instructor use of the app.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Stage 2 of the project will focus on developing the learning activities and considering the student perspective. Major tasks for this stage will include:</p>
      <ol class="ol">
        <li>Additional research into the latest pedagogical practices and theories for teaching languages.</li>
        <li>Developing pedagogically effective learning activities.</li>
        <li>Conducting user research with students to determine their pain points and needs and incorporating the data gathered into the wireframes and flows.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Additional stages of development are still being mapped out.</p>
